    "\n",
    "- **Local vs. Global Scope:**  \n",
    "  Inside the function `eggs`, the line `spam = spam + ham` attempts to update the variable `spam`. Since an assignment is made, Python treats `spam` as a local variable. However, the right-hand side of the assignment (`spam + ham`) tries to access the variable `spam` before it has been defined locally. This leads to error because the function cannot find a local variable named `spam` at the time of evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Type Mismatch:**  \n",
    "  Additionally, `spam` is a list and `ham` is a tuple. Directly concatenating a list with a tuple is not allowed in Python. They must be of the same type (e.g., both lists) for the `+` operator to work.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To fix the error and achieve the desired outcome, you can modify the function `eggs` as follows:\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. **Declare `spam` as a global variable** within the function so that it refers to the variable defined outside.\n",
    "2. **Convert `ham` to a list** before concatenating it with `spam`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def eggs(ham):\n",
    "    global spam\n",
    "    spam = spam + list(ham)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Alternative Solution:*  \n",
    "You could also use the `extend` method, which appends the elements of `ham` (a tuple) to the list `spam` without needing to reassign it:\n",

    "def eggs(ham):\n",
    "    global spam\n",
    "    spam.extend(ham)\n",
