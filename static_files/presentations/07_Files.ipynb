You learned to read an entire file at once and read through a file’s contents one line at a time. You learned to write to a file and append text onto the end of a file. You learned how to store Python data structures so you can save information your users provide, preventing them from having to start over each time they run a program. Finally, You read about exceptions and how to handle the exceptions you’re likely to see in your programs.
