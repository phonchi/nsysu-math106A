It offers a high-performance, richly functional n-dimensional array type called `array,` which, from this point forward, we’ll refer to by its synonym, `array.` Operations on arrays are up to one or two orders of magnitude faster than those on lists. Many Python libraries depend on `NumPy.` Many popular data science libraries such as Pandas, SciPy (Scientific Python), and Keras (for deep learning) are built on or depend on NumPy.\n","\n","In this chapter, we explore the array’s basic capabilities. The built-in lists can have multiple dimensions. You generally process multi-dimensional lists with nested loops or list comprehensions with multiple clauses.
