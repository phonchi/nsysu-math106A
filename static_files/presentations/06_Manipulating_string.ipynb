You will make use of indexing, slicing, and string methods in almost every Python program you write. The programs you are writing now don’t seem too sophisticated—they don’t have graphical user interfaces with images and colorful text. So far, you’re displaying text with `print()` and letting the user enter text with `input()`. However, another way to manipulate large amounts of text is by reading and writing files directly off the hard drive. You’ll learn how to do this with Python later on.\n","\n","That just about covers all the basic concepts of Python programming! You’ll continue to learn new concepts throughout the rest of this course, but you now know enough to start writing some useful programs that can automate tasks.

Try copying the source code for each program by hand and then make modifications to see how they affect the behavior of the program. Once you have an understanding of how the program works, try re-creating the program yourself from scratch.
